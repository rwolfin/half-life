LEVEL DESCRIPTION:

My fellow mapper friend, cuda, made the map assault back in 2002 and this is a new version of it. Completely rebuilt
Tons of secrets and my favorite air strike.

SERVER ADMIN NOTES: The map sets all players to be equiped with weapons and ammo every
time they spawn. Since the players spawn with weapons, those weapons might night be available for pickup
but ammo is available. This was done to cut back on the amount of entities in the map in hopes to prevent
the map from crashing due to the large amount of entities already in the map.
